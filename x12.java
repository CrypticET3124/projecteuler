/*
 * The sequence of triangle numbers is generated by adding the natural numbers.
 * So the 7th triangle number would be 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28. The first
 * ten terms would be:
 * 
 * 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, 28, 36, 45, 55, ...
 * 
 * Let us list the factors of the first seven triangle numbers:
 * 
 * 1: 1 3: 1,3 6: 1,2,3,6 10: 1,2,5,10 15: 1,3,5,15 21: 1,3,7,21 28:
 * 1,2,4,7,14,28 We can see that 28 is the first triangle number to have over
 * five divisors.
 * 
 * What is the value of the first triangle number to have over five hundred
 * divisors?
